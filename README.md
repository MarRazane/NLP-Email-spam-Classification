# NLP-Email-spam-Classification

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on email spam classification. The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning model that can accurately classify emails as either spam or non-spam based on their content.

## Features

- **NLP Techniques**: The project leverages various NLP techniques, including tokenization, feature extraction, and model training, to effectively classify emails.

- **Dataset**: We used a labeled dataset for training and evaluating the model. The dataset includes a mixture of spam and non-spam emails, allowing the model to learn patterns and make predictions.

- **Machine Learning Model**: The core of the project is a machine learning model, implemented using popular libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow. The model is trained on the provided dataset and can be used for predicting the spam probability of new emails.

## Installation
